# vsd-tapeout-w0
The **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program** aims to train participants in the full digital ASIC flow using open-source EDA tools: from writing RTL, synthesis, placement & routing, through to GDSII generation and tapeout readiness.
Over a 10-week program, you'll build skills and a project portfolio documenting each stage of the flow.
