# Week 1: Introduction to Verilog RTL Design & Synthesis

This week introduces **Verilog RTL design**, **simulation using Icarus Verilog**, **waveform visualization via GTKWave**, and **basic logic synthesis using Yosys**. The content is divided into **5 days**, each with its own detailed README file.

## ðŸ”¹ How to Use This Repository

1. Navigate to the **Day folder** you want to study.
2. Open the corresponding README for detailed instructions.
3. Follow the **compilation, simulation, and synthesis steps**.
4. Use GTKWave to **visualize waveforms** and verify your designs.

## ðŸ”¹ Tools Used This Week

* **Icarus Verilog (`iverilog`)** â€“ for compiling and simulating Verilog code.
* **GTKWave** â€“ for waveform visualization.
* **Yosys** â€“ for synthesizing RTL to gate-level netlists.
* **Sky130/Other Standard Cell Libraries** â€“ for technology mapping.
