# Setting Up the Workspace

Before starting the workshop, let’s prepare the environment where we’ll run all the experiments.

### 🔹 Step 1: Make a Project Directory

First, create a directory called **`VSD`**.
This directory will serve as the central workspace throughout the sessions.

```
mkdir VSD
```

### 🔹 Step 2: Move Into the Directory

Switch into the newly created folder and createa another folder caller **VLSI** so that all files are kept organized in one place.

```
cd VSD
mkdir VLSI
```
### 🔹 Step 4: Move Into the Directory

Switch into the newly created folder so that all files are kept organized in one place.

```
cd VLSI
```

### 🔹 Step 5: Fetch the Repository

Now, clone the official OpenLane GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kunalg123/sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop.git
```
List the files in the folder using **ls** command
```
ls
cd sky130RTLDesignAndSynthesisWorkshop
ls
cd verilog_files
```
